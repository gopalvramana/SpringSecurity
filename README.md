****************************************************************
When integrating OAuth2 into your API, you typically need to configure two applications in the Identity Provider (like Auth0 or Okta):

1. Client Application (Represents the frontend or external system consuming your API)
   This can be a web app, mobile app, or another backend service.
   It will authenticate with the Identity Provider to obtain an access token.
   You configure it with details like client_id, client_secret, allowed callback URLs, and grant types.

2. API (Resource Server) (Represents your Spring Boot API)
   This is the protected backend API that requires authentication.
   The API should be registered as an "audience" in the Identity Provider.
   It verifies the access token issued by the Identity Provider before processing requests.
   Typically, it is configured to enforce JWT validation.

This repository exposes Theree APIs
 1. Token end point for generating tokens
 2. Two secured end points which can be accessed by using token generated by token endpoint.
